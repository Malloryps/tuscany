<h1>Black Goose Bistro Gallery</h1>
<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>
<p><a href="bread.html"><img src="thumbnails/bread-200.jpg" alt="close-up of sliced rustic bread"></a><br>
We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<h2>Our Burgers</h2>
<p><a href="burgers.html"><img src="thumbnails/burgers-200.jpg" alt="close up of burgers and buns" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>
<p><a href="fish.html"><img src="thumbnails/fish-200.jpg" alt="Fancy plate of fish on a white plate" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>

<h2>Our Chicken</h2>
<p><a href="chicken.html"><img src="thumbnails/chicken-200.jpg" alt="plate of chicken" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
Our chicken is hand breaded and fried to perfection so you get the nice crunch on the outside and the juicy inside that drips down the chin. Just the thought of it can make any customer's mouth water. </p>

<h2>Fresh Fries</h2>
<p><a href="fries.html"><img src="thumbnails/fries-200.jpg" alt="plate of fries and a cup of ketchup" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
Need a side to go with that? Try our crispy fries, never soggy and never burnt. Don't worry, we don't shy away from piling those fries high!</p>

<h2>Tabouleh</h2>
<p><a href="tabouleh.html"><img src="thumbnails/tabouleh-200.jpg" alt="A close shot of tabouleh" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
Try this Arab salad along with our bread for a flavorful blast that will leave you wanting more. All the chopped ingredients such as the tomatoes, onions, an parsley are all fresh and healthy.</p>
